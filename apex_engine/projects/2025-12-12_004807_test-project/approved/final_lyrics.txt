[INTRO] (Industrial noise, distant siren, heavy vinyl crackle) Yeah... System offline. (Offline) Night shade. (Shade) Watch the grid collapse.

[HOOK] (Heavy distorted 808s kick in here with Cowbell melody) Drift through the smoke, chrome on the dash City in ruins, we turning to ash (Ash, ash) Eyes wide shut, pedal to the floor Demon in the engine screaming out for more Slide. (Slide) Slide. (Slide) Ghost in the shell, nowhere to hide.

[VERSE 1 - Rapid-Fire Triplet Flow] Riding through the city with no pity in my soul Lost inside the static, losing all control (Control) Circuit board breaker, the undertaker Meeting my maker inside of the vapor 808 bumping, the pulse is jumping Venom in the veins and the heart is pumping Switch lanes. (Skrrt) Mind games. (Aye) Walking through the fire but I never feel the flames.

[BRIDGE - Chopped & Screwed Section] (Tempo feels like it slows down, pitch drops low) N-N-Night calls... night... night calls... System f-f-fail... failure... Walking... walking through the... (Deep voice) NEON GRAVE.

[VERSE 2 - Aggressive / Memphis Flow] Back on the attack, fade to black Got the devil on my shoulder and he talking smack Cowbell ringing like a death knell toll Paid the price, yeah I sold my soul High-tech, low-life, sharp as a knife Running from the shadows all of my life (What? What?) Double cup spill, time to kill Popping on the grid just for the thrill.

[HOOK] Drift through the smoke, chrome on the dash City in ruins, we turning to ash (Ash, ash) Eyes wide shut, pedal to the floor Demon in the engine screaming out for more Slide. (Slide) Slide. (Slide) Ghost in the shell, nowhere to hide.

[OUTRO] (Vocals heavily distorted and fading into reverb) Nowhere to hide... (Hide...) Disconnect. (Click)
